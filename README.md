# channels-should-exclude-from-campaign


When actually reviewing the top-spending placements, I often see right off the bat they’re all kids channels. Yeah, this isn’t what we want to show our clients or bosses, and most likely the marketer isn’t doing anything wrong. I’m not here to parent shame anyone, but it’s incredibly common for parents to give their kids their phone or tablet to distract them so they can finally get some work done around the house. (Look, I’ve done it so I’m not scolding anyone). So the smart PPC marketer could technically be going after the right user, but that user has given their device to someone else.

I’m sick of this happening. So in order to try (really need to stress the word try here) to limit our ads showing up on these channels, I started creating a list of channel placements that I saw consistently in our client’s placement reports. I also took a proactive approach and searched on YouTube myself. I looked up terms like “kids, childrens, toys, unboxing, kids games, etc.” I then filtered by just channels and then sorted the channels with the most video views. I now have a list of more than 1,400 channels we can add as exclusions proactively.
I’m going to go over a scenario I run into often. I wish I could see your face when reading this to know we’re in agreement.

When I launch new video campaigns or ad groups in Google Ads, I like to check the placements every day for at least a week to see where my ads are initially shown. So many times, these are the placement results I see…
